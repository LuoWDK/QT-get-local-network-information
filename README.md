# A Qt-based Network Application
---

**Features**
1. It support to query network information, including localhost name, localhost ip address and device address.
2. It implements a UDP-based application, which send message from server to client by using UDP.

**Notes**
- I directly implement three windows (network information, UDP server, UDP client).
- Later on, I may beautify the interfaces.
